# Stolen Bike - Fullstack

## Context
Stolen bikes are a typical problem in Strasbourg. The Police want to be more efficient in resolving stolen bike cases. They decided to build a software that can automate their processes — the software that you're going to develop.

## Product Requirements
### Back
- [ ] Bike owners can report a stolen bike.
- [ ] New stolen bike cases should be automatically assigned to any free police officer.
- [ ] A police officer can only handle one stolen bike case at a time.
- [ ] When the Police find a bike, the case is marked as resolved and the responsible police officer becomes available to take a new stolen bike case.
- [ ] The system should be able to assign unassigned stolen bike cases automatically when a police officer becomes available.
- [ ] Mock some bikes and 3 police officers

### Front
- [ ] Develop the interface you think will be the more efficient (no need to describe anything, it should only be functional).
- Requirements :
    - [ ] One tab will display the user form
    - [ ] One tab will display the stolen bikes and the police actions
    - [ ] One tab will display current assignments
- Extra: Use your prefered state manager

## Your Mission
Your task is to provide APIs and a frontend application that satisfies all requirements above.

Please stick to the Product Requirements. You should not implement authorisation and authentication, as they are not important for the assessment. Assume everyone can make requests to any API.

## Tech Requirements
- Node.js
- **Tests (quality and coverage)**
- You are free to use any React framework, but it’s recommended that you use one that you’re good at
- Use only SQL Database
- Typescript is a plus
